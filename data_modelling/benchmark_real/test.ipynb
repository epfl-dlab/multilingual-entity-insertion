      "Context: She decided to go back to the doo-wop genre on her fifth album after her song \"Title\" became famous on TikTok in 2021. She became more emotional and strong after getting pregnant, which helped her write better songs. Trainor wrote songs for the album which she thought people on TikTok would like. She got attention on it after making videos with Chris Olsen. Trainor released the song \"Bad for Me\" in June 2022. Trainor and Sean Douglas wrote \"Made You Look\" with its producer, Federico Vindver. Her therapist asked her to look at herself with no clothes on for five minutes. This and Trainor's low confidence about her body inspired the song. Trainor wrote the words \"I'll make you double take / Soon as I walk away / Call up your chiropractor just in case your neck break\" about how her husband, Daryl Sabara, bends to look at her when she leaves a room. Other lyrics were inspired by the things he does for her. Trainor wanted to continue writing songs about self-confidence as she had done on her older albums and make it easy to relate to like her song \"All About That Bass\" (2014).\n",
